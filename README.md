# 🌈 Queer Journal

**Queer Journal** is a simple, offline-first PWA (Progressive Web App) for notes, memos, schedules, and journaling — built with love for the spectrum.  

✨ Features:
- 📝 Add daily notes with **date, time, mood, tags, and optional images**  
- 🔒 **PIN lock** to keep your journal private  
- ⏰ Set **alarms/reminders** that play a sound + browser notification  
- 🔍 Search & filter by text or tags  
- 💾 Import/Export all entries as `.json` (your data stays local in your browser)  
- 📆 Switch views: **List, Day, Week, Alarm**  
- 📱 Installable as a PWA (works offline, add to homescreen)
